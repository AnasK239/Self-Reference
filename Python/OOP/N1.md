**What is OOP in Python?**

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects".

1.  **Everything is an Object:** In Python, fundamental data types (like integers, lists, strings) and custom-defined types are all objects. Every object has a type.
2.  **Objects as Data Abstractions:** Objects bundle data (attributes) and procedures (methods) that operate on that data. They represent a combination of:
    *   **Internal Representation:** The data stored within the object (data attributes). This should ideally be kept private (though Python doesn't strictly enforce this).
    *   **Interface:** The methods provided to interact with the object's data and perform actions. This hides the internal implementation details.
3.  **Core Actions:** You can create, manipulate, and destroy objects. Python uses "garbage collection" to automatically reclaim memory from objects that are no longer referenced.
4.  **Advantages:**
    *   **Bundling:** Keeps related data and functions together.
    *   **Modularity:** Allows breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts (classes).
    *   **Code Reuse:** Classes can be reused in different parts of a program or in other programs. Inheritance allows building upon existing code.
    *   **Abstraction:** Hides complex implementation details behind a simple interface.
    *   **Decomposition:** Helps structure code logically, often mirroring real-world entities.

**Key Concepts and Code Examples**

**1. Classes and Instances**

*   **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that all objects of that type will have.
*   **Instance:** A specific object created from a class. Each instance has its own set of data attributes but shares the methods defined by the class.

*   **Defining a Class:** Uses the `class` keyword. By convention, class names use `CamelCase`. It often inherits from `object` (though this is implicit in Python 3).

    ```python
    #  Basic Class Definition inheriting from object
    # 'object' is the base class for all Python objects, providing default behaviors.
    class Coordinate(object):
        # Attributes and methods defined here (indented)
        pass # pass means do nothing, placeholder

    class Animal(object):
        # ... definition ...
        pass
    ```

**2. Attributes**

*   **Data Attributes:** Variables that hold the state/data of an object. Often initialized in the `__init__` method.
    *   Example: For a `Coordinate`, `x` and `y` values. For an `Animal`, `age` and `name`.
*   **Methods (Procedural Attributes):** Functions defined within a class that operate on the object's data or perform actions related to the object.
    *   Example: For a `Coordinate`, calculating `distance`. For an `Animal`, `speak()` or `get_age()`.

**3. The `__init__` Method (Constructor)**

*   A special method called automatically when you create a new instance of the class.
*   Used to initialize the instance's data attributes.
*   The first parameter is always `self`.

    ```python
    # Defining __init__ for Coordinate
    class Coordinate(object):
        # Constructor: initializes a new Coordinate object
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            # self refers to the specific instance being created
            # x and y are data attributes of the instance
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

    #Defining __init__ for Animal
    class Animal(object):
        def __init__(self, age): # Initializer takes age
           self.age = age       # Instance variable for age
           self.name = None   # Instance variable for name, initially None
    ```

**4. The `self` Parameter**

*   The first parameter of any instance method (including `__init__`).
*   Represents the instance of the class itself.
*   Python passes the instance automatically when you call a method using dot notation (`instance.method()`). You don't provide it explicitly during the call.
*   Used within methods to access the instance's attributes and other methods (`self.attribute`, `self.other_method()`).

**5. Creating Instances (Instantiation)**

*   Call the class name as if it were a function, passing arguments required by `__init__` (excluding `self`).

    ```python
    #  Creating instances of Coordinate
    c = Coordinate(3, 4)     # Creates a Coordinate instance, __init__(self, 3, 4) is called
    origin = Coordinate(0, 0) # Creates another instance

    #  Creating an instance of Animal
    a = Animal(3) # Creates an Animal instance with age 3
    ```

**6. Accessing Attributes and Methods (Dot Notation)**

*   Use the dot (`.`) operator on an instance to access its attributes or call its methods.

    ```python
    # Accessing data attribute
    print(c.x)          # Accesses the x attribute of instance c (Output: 3)
    print(origin.x)     # Accesses the x attribute of instance origin (Output: 0)

    # Calling an instance method
    # Assume Coordinate class has a distance method as defined
    # print(c.distance(origin)) # Calls the distance method on instance c, passing origin as 'other'

    #  Accessing data attribute (allowed but discouraged for modification)
    # print(a.age)

    #  Calling a getter method (preferred way)
    # Assume Animal class has get_age method as defined
    # print(a.get_age())
    ```

**7. Defining Methods**

*   Define functions inside the class definition. They always take `self` as the first argument.

    ```python
   
    class Coordinate(object):
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            self.x = x
            self.y = y

        # Method to calculate distance to another Coordinate object
        def distance(self, other):
            x_diff_sq = (self.x - other.x)**2 # Access self.x and other.x
            y_diff_sq = (self.y - other.y)**2
            return (x_diff_sq + y_diff_sq)**0.5

    
    class Animal(object):
        def __init__(self, age):
            self.age = age
            self.name = None

        def get_age(self): # Getter for age
            return self.age

        def get_name(self): # Getter for name
             return self.name

        def set_age(self, newage): # Setter for age
             self.age = newage

        def set_name(self, newname=""): # Setter for name with default value
             self.name = newname
    ```

**8. Special Methods (Dunder Methods)**

*   Methods with double underscores at the beginning and end (`__methodname__`).
*   Allow you to define how built-in functions or operators work with your objects.
*   `__init__`: Constructor.
*   `__str__`: Defines the string representation returned by `print(instance)` or `str(instance)`. Must return a string.
*   `__add__`, `__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc.: Operator overloading. Define how operators like `+`, `==`, `<` work between instances of your class.

    ```python
    
    class Coordinate(object):
        # ... (init and other methods) ...
        def __str__(self):
            # Returns a user-friendly string representation
            return "<" + str(self.x) + "," + str(self.y) + ">"

    # Usage:
    # c = Coordinate(3, 4)
    # print(c) # Output: <3,4> (because __str__ is defined)

    
    class Rabbit(Animal):
        # ... (init, tag, etc.) ...
        # Defines what happens when you use '+' between two Rabbit instances
        def __add__(self, other):
            # Returning a new Rabbit object (representing offspring)
            # Assumes Rabbit init takes age, parent1, parent2
            return Rabbit(0, self, other) # Creates a new baby rabbit

    
    class Rabbit(Animal):
        # ... (init, tag, getters, etc.) ...
        # Defines how to check if two Rabbit instances are equal (==)
        def __eq__(self, other):
            # Rabbits are equal if they share the same parents (ignoring order)
            # Assumes parents have a unique 'rid' attribute accessible via get_rid()
            # NOTE: Need careful handling if parents can be None
            parent1_self = self.get_parent1()
            parent2_self = self.get_parent2()
            parent1_other = other.get_parent1()
            parent2_other = other.get_parent2()

            # Simplified logic assuming parents exist and have rid
            # A more robust implementation would check for None parents
            same_parents = (parent1_self.rid == parent1_other.rid and
                            parent2_self.rid == parent2_other.rid)
            opposite_parents = (parent1_self.rid == parent2_other.rid and
                                parent2_self.rid == parent1_other.rid)

            return same_parents or opposite_parents
    ```

**9. Inheritance**

*   Allows a new class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (parent/superclass).
*   Promotes code reuse and establishes hierarchies ("is-a" relationship, e.g., a Cat *is an* Animal).
*   Syntax: `class ChildClass(ParentClass):`
*   The child class can:
    *   Use inherited methods/attributes directly.
    *   Add new methods/attributes.
    *   Override inherited methods by defining a method with the same name.
*   Method Lookup: When `instance.method()` is called, Python looks for `method` in the instance's class first. If not found, it looks in the parent class, then the grandparent, and so on, up the hierarchy.

    ```python

    class Cat(Animal): # Cat inherits from Animal
        # Add new method specific to Cat
        def speak(self):
            print("meow")

        # Override the __str__ method inherited from Animal
        def __str__(self):
            # Assuming name and age are inherited/set correctly
            return "cat:" + str(self.name) + ":" + str(self.age)

     methods
    class Person(Animal):
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            # Call the parent class's __init__ to initialize shared attributes (age)
            Animal.__init__(self, age)
            # Initialize attributes specific to Person (or use setters)
            self.set_name(name) # Uses inherited setter
            self.friends = []    # Add a new data attribute

        def get_friends(self):
             return self.friends

        def add_friend(self, fname):
            if fname not in self.friends:
                self.friends.append(fname)

        def speak(self): # Override speak
            print("hello")

        # Add new method
        def age_diff(self, other):
            # Assumes other object also has an age attribute
            diff = self.age - other.age
            print(abs(diff), "year difference")

        # Override __str__
        def __str__(self):
            return "person:" + str(self.name) + ":" + str(self.age)

    class Student(Person):
         def __init__(self, name, age, major=None):
             # Call Person's __init__
             Person.__init__(self, name, age)
             # Add new attribute specific to Student
             self.major = major

         def change_major(self, major):
             self.major = major

         def speak(self): # Override speak again
             # Example using random module (needs 'import random' at top of file)
             r = random.random()
             if r < 0.25:
                 print("i have homework")
             # ... other conditions ...
             else:
                 print("i am watching tv")

         # Override __str__
         def __str__(self):
             return "student:"+str(self.name)+":"+str(self.age)+":"+str(self.major)
    ```

**10. Class Variables vs. Instance Variables**

*   **Instance Variables:** Belong to a specific instance. Defined inside methods (usually `__init__`) using `self.variable_name`. Each instance has its own copy. (e.g., `self.age`, `self.name`, `self.rid`, `self.parent1`).
*   **Class Variables:** Belong to the class itself. Defined directly inside the class scope, outside any method. Shared by *all* instances of the class. (e.g., `tag` in the `Rabbit` class). Can be accessed using `ClassName.variable_name`.

    ```python
    
    class Rabbit(Animal):
        # Class variable - shared by all Rabbit instances
        tag = 1

        def __init__(self, age, parent1=None, parent2=None):
            Animal.__init__(self, age)
            # Instance variables - specific to each Rabbit
            self.parent1 = parent1
            self.parent2 = parent2
            # Use the class variable to assign a unique ID to this instance
            self.rid = Rabbit.tag
            # Increment the class variable for the next instance
            Rabbit.tag += 1
    ```

**11. Information Hiding and Getters/Setters**

*   **Encapsulation Principle:** Ideally, an object's internal data (attributes) should not be accessed directly from outside the class. Access should happen through methods (getters and setters).
*   **Python's Approach:** Python doesn't strictly enforce information hiding. You *can* access attributes directly (`instance.attribute`).
