After making a new class if you want another class to inherit its attributes Ex: CLASS ANIMALS   ,, NEW CLASS CAT Should inherit animals properties


syntax when forming the new class

public class <child class> extends <parent class from which attributes and methods are inherited>{
    
}



The Parent Class could be refered to as super the child inherits attributes from the super:

if the super constructor requires 2 arguments  EX:  Parent(a1,a2)

and the child constructor requires 3 arguments  child(a1,a2,a3)
						
						you must provide the first two arguments to the Parent first 

						Syntax  ,  super(a1,a2) , then the last argument can be provided to the child

							, ,  this.a3 

						Note ## a1,a2 are still accesible to any methods in the child class using this.<aX>

Method overriding is defining the same method inherited by the child inside the child itself with different parameters.
The overriden method is used when using child.method
