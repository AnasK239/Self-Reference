When declaring a new class if you want to keep track of how many times this class is constructed 

therefore you have to keep track by making a static int track;

then track++; in the constructor ########## making it static means that it will be shared by every new instance of construction rather 

than it normally being individual EX: if you create obj1 and obj2  with a static track >>> track = 2
									
								    obj1 and obj2 with non static track >>>> track = 1

Its better to access the static variable through the class name rather than the objects in it

			ClassName.track

STATIC:

OWNED BY THE CLASS

SHARED BY THE CLASS OBJECTS
