They help avoid tampering with senstive data be it intentional or not.

Do you know how you can set a file to be readable only in windows well it's roughly the same.

Getters are methods that make a file READABLE.

Setters are methods that make a file WRITABLE.

####### First Assign all attributes as private

Assume car class

Ex: private String model;   >>>> model is now inaccessible outside the class in which it has been defined.

public class Car {
    
    private String color;
    private String model;
    private int price;

    Car(String model,String color,int price)
    {
        this.model=model;
        this.price=price;
        this.color =color;
    }

     String getmodel()
    {
        return this.model;				######## this a set of getters for the attributes of the Car these are publicly accessible
    }								Ex: print car attributes in main
								
    int getprice()					Car car =new Car("Corvette", "Yellow", 20000);
								System.out.println(car.getcolor() + " " + car.getmodel() + " " + car.getprice());
    {								
        return this.price;				car.setColor("Blue"); >>> I painted my Corvette Blue ^-^
    }
    String getcolor()
    {
        return this.color;
    }

	String setColor(String color)  >>> this is a setter for the color 
		this.color = color;
}
