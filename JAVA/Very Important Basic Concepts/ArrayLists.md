# ArrayLists
---
If you know C++, this is just a `vector`. A `vector` is just a resizable array.

## Array Lists Store OBJECTS

```java
Array<OBJECT_TYPE> arrayName = new ArrayList<>();
```
---
## Methods

- `.add()`
- `.remove()`
- `.set(index, "whatever you want")`
- `.get(index)`
- `.size()`
- `Collections.sort(arrayName)` (Collections utility needs to be imported first)

---
## Printing an ArrayList

You can print the ArrayList immediately:

```java
System.out.println(arrayName);
```

Or iterate through it and print each element individually.
