A very important point is that by using interfaces a class can have many parents and inherit their attributes.
Unlike normal inheritance where a class can only have one parent.
									
									(Multiple inheritance-like behaviour)

## If a class inherits from an interface it MUST finish defining the methods in the interface.


public class <class name> implements <interface name> {      "Think of it like this : the class implements a blue-print 
																defined by the interface"
	 @Override
    public void <blue print method name>()
    {
        // finish implementation
    }
}

#################### MULTIPLE INTERFACES ##################

public class <class name> implements <interface name1 , interface name2> {      "Think of it like this : Some animals considered prey
												 	and predators at the same time so they implement both blue prints"
																
	 @Override
    public void <blue print method name1>()
    {
        // finish implementation
    }

	@Override
    public void <blue print method name2>()
    {
        // finish implementation
    }
}
