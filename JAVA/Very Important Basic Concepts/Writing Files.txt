You have 4 options

1. FileWriter: Good for small or medium-sized text files.

2. BufferedReader: Better performance for large amounts of text.

3. PrintWriter: Best for structured data, like reports or logs.

4. FileOutputStream: Best for binary files (e.g., images, audio files).


Writing files is inherently dangerous behaviour so we need to catch exceptions::

        try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("Location\\test.txt");) { **note when adding location use \\ not \ 
												  you can also replace what's inside FileWriter() with a String object

            writer.write("I like onion rings");
            
        } catch (IOException e) {

            System.out.println("Couldn't write file");
        }

This will output a .txt file containing your message.
