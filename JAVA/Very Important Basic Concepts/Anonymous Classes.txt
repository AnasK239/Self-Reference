Anonymous class = A class that doesn't have a name. Cannot be reused.

Add custom behavior without having to create a new class.

Often used for one time uses (TimerTask, Runnable, callbacks).


Used when you want to make an object of a certain class but its has a slightly different method.
Therfore it would be redundant to go and define a new class just for this one object instead create the new object as an annonymous class.

Ex:  Assume a Class called Dog , when Dog speaks it says woof  , Assume we want a Dog object scooby-doo , scooby-doo talks english.

so we need to override the speak method of dog

>>> Dog dog1 = new Dog(); >>> this is a normal dog >>> dog1.speak()  = woof

>>> Dog scoobyDoo = new Dog() 
{	
	@Override
	void speak()
	{
		System.out.println("english mumble");
	}
} >>> this is scooby-Doo >>> scoobyDoo.speak() = english mumble
