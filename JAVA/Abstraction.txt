Remmember that a class has ATTRIBUTES and METHODS and CONSTRUCTORS


Hiding implementation details meaning you dont care about what goes on under the hood.

public abstract class <name> {

} 

###### you cannot make any object of class <name> its merely an abstract for other classes (AKA this is whats under the hood)

the other classes inherit the abstract class properties ( Gas pedal is connected to the engine one way or another ).


The abstract class contains either concrete or abstract methods :

abstract methods >>> are methods that must be implemented EX: a Shape abstract class must contain an area method. ( abstract double area(); )

And each child of shape should have ITS OWN DEFINITION of area By OVERRIDING the Parent method ( Triangle , rectangle , etc..) 

concrete methods are the opposite >>> they could be implemented or not and are INHERITED By all child classes with the same definition
NOT OVERRIDEN.
